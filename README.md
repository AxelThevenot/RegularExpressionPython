## Run the programm

Open the `file.json` file in an editor and run the `main.py` script to visualize the regex on test sentences you wrote. (Don't forget to save your `file.json` else the changes will be not taking into account)

## Use the programm
Write your regex after the key `"Regular Expressions":`
Write you sentences in the list after the `"Texts to test":` separeted by a comma `,`

Don't forget it is a JSON file. In a JSON file the `\` is an escape character. Double it like that `\\` to have a validate single blackslash

Enjoy !
